# SJ Spring Meet Notes

- General Notes on the use of Divisions
  - One of my ongoing complaints is the use of Divisions when inappropriate ...
    - But Steve says he gets lots of questions even registrants don't see categories U14 U16 U18 etc.
    - So maybe the lie us useful but we have to be careful of the below on import
      - age-ups when allowed are lost (they put themsleves in a different division but then we ignore division and just use age)
        - so disallow age-ups is one option
        - permit ag-ups but only on request by email
        - I could programtically deal with this but not in a way that would be usable by anyone else

  - The other is not using Divisions when appropriate e.g. SO, Para, University
    - if we don't identify these athletes separately then they get co-mingled with other athletes
    - so please add those devisions if allowed and create the events for them to enter on Trackie

  - Then what can be done is:
    - Create Hytek Meets that have Divcisions say: Age Class, SO, Para (other possibilties could be NBIAA, University, etc if they are being kept to their own events).
    - Collapse the age divisions for Age Classes (U14 U16 U18 etc into Age Class)

## Review of Trackie Registration prior to the Meet (2024-04-13 RJC)
- Questions?
  - How are you planning to deal with NBIAA athletes
    - No way for NBIAA athletes to enter Grade
    - NBIAA athletes can put themselves in Junior or Senior but that information will be lost unless the meet file has those divisions
    - If the meet file has those divisions then what are we doing with the other divisions U14 U16 U18 U20 Senior and Masters

- Pros
  - Meet Information has a date stamped document. This is mportant so updates can be identified
    - FYI: Trackie also has a News Feature. I suggest trying that out to indicate when updates are made and *what* has changed
  - Regsitration deadlines provided in our time zone

- Cons
  - Meet Information (April 11) document has the following issues
    - top of p.1 "Final Schedules will be provided by May 19th, *2022*" should be 2024  
    - Registration section:  no "19" in English version of date, No Midnight Atlantic Time in French version
  - I much prefer Steve's Meet Package layout see https://files.trackie.com/uploads/event/2024-02-08-14-41-10-1110117540-906.pdf?rand=472908489
    - especially his layout of field event schedule by area i.e. Horizontal Jumps, SHotput Circle, Long Throws, etc
    - especially his layout of who can compete in which event
